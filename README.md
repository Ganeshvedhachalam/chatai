## Introduction
This is a simple chat application that simulates a conversation between a user and an AI. The AI responses are based on predefined data stored in a JSON file.

## How to Start the Service and Use the Application
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm should be installed on your machine.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/chat-application.git
cd chat-application
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Running the Application
Start the development server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
Open your browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:3000
## Using the Application
You will be greeted with an initial chat screen.
Type your message in the input field at the bottom and press "Enter" or click the send button.
The AI will respond based on the predefined questions and answers in Chatmodel.json.
You can scroll through the chat history.
Use the feedback button to provide feedback on the responses.
 ## Reasoning Behind Technical Choices
React: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering using the virtual DOM.
Material-UI (MUI): Utilized for its comprehensive library of pre-built components and styling solutions, providing a polished and responsive UI.
React Router: Employed for handling client-side routing, enabling a seamless single-page application experience.
Context API: Used to manage global state across the application, simplifying state management for components like theme and chat history.
## Reasoning Behind Design Choices
Component Structure: Each component serves a specific purpose, improving code maintainability and reusability. Components like Navbar, ChatInputForm, ChatCard, and FeedbackModal are modular and can be easily updated or replaced.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across different device sizes. Media queries and flexbox are used extensively for layout adjustments.
Scroll Behavior: The chat container auto-scrolls to the latest message, enhancing the user experience by keeping the most recent messages in view.
## Trade-offs, Omissions, and Future Improvements
Limited AI Responses: The current AI responses are based on a static JSON file. Implementing a backend with a machine learning model could provide more dynamic and intelligent responses.
Feedback System: The feedback system is basic. Future enhancements could include storing feedback in a database and using it to improve AI responses.
Error Handling: More robust error handling and validation are needed for a production environment.
Styling: Additional styling and theming options could be added to allow more customization and improve the visual appeal.
## Future Improvements
Backend Integration: Integrate with a backend service to handle user authentication, persist chat history, and improve AI responses.
Enhanced UI/UX: Implement more interactive and user-friendly UI elements.
Accessibility: Improve accessibility features to ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.
Performance Optimization: Optimize performance for faster load times and smoother interactions.
